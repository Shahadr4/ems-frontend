## 📋 Project Description

**Employee Management System (EMS)** is a full-stack web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
It allows administrators to manage employees, departments, and users, while users can manage their attendance and view history.

This project was developed to demonstrate a real-world use case of **role-based access** in a web application:

✅ Admin has full CRUD capabilities  
✅ Users have restricted access to their own features  

> **Deployed and hosted on Vercel for live usage.**
